Hello! I am @royfieldsmcclanahan, and I am a full-stack containerized web app developer.

My main goal on Github is to provide helpful code that is multipurpose while remaining grounded in efficiency and usability.

My areas of expertise include content gating, containerized development and deployment, API development and microservices architecture.

Currently my largest area of study is in Kubernetes container orchestration and AI/Machine Learning.

I am excited to collaborate especially in my areas of study, so please contact me if you would like to work together :)

Roy
